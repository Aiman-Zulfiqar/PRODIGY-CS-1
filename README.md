This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, allowing users to input a message and a shift value for encryption and decryption. It handles both upper and lower case letters, maintaining their case during the process. The program takes user inputs for message and shift value, then prints the encrypted or decrypted message accordingly.
